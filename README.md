# Neural Network Radio Frequency applications for device verification using Scattering Parameters

This repository contains neural network-based applications for RF device verification using scattering parameters, inspired by my work at Infineon Technologies AG.

The applications analyze scattering parameters from a Virtual Network Analyzer (VNA) to verify good working devices, detecting embedded or de-embedded devices, among other use cases. They were trained on a collection of scattering parameter data, including good devices (within company-specified ranges) and bad devices (outside these ranges). Unfortunately, this data cannot be made publicly available.

These applications demonstrate the potential of neural networks in RF device verification and can be extended to other areas, such as device characterization, anomaly detection for frequencies not typically monitored, or other RF device analysis tasks.
